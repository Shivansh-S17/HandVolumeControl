# VirtualMouse
This project creates a virtual mouse that you can control using hand gestures. By tracking your hand movements with MediaPipe and OpenCV, it allows you to move the cursor and perform clicks without a physical mouse. Simply use your index finger to move the cursor and pinch your index and middle fingers to click.
